          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            According to a 2021 Pew research conducted in the United States, <br><br>
Women now earn a majority of all undergraduate and advanced degrees, but their share is less in STEM fields.<br><br>
In STEM, women make up a large majority of all workers in health-related jobs, but are highly underrepresented in fields like engineering and computer science.<br><br>
Black and Hispanic workers remain underrepresented in the STEM workforce (9 percent and 8 percent, respectively) compared with their share of all workers (11 percent and 17 percent, respectively).<br><br><br>
Also, recent statistics reported by the United Nations shows that women make up 8% of the global total in manufacturing, construction and engineering programs and only 5% of all mathematics and statistics students, globally, are women.

          <h2>The Need for Change</h2>
          <p>
            If females make up nearly half of the global population, then it makes up nearly half of the world’s intellect and potential.<br> Throughout the history of STEM. women have broken through “impossible” barricades, and are still doing so.<br> From the likes of Elizebeth Friedman and Katherine Johnson to the recent likes of Katherine Freese and Pardis Sabeti, the intellectual contribution of females in STEM must be embraced. 
          </p>

  <div class="way">
          <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
          <p>
            The Female Greatness is aimed at minimizing the gender disparity in STEM by increasing the population and inclusion of females in STEM through a global network.
